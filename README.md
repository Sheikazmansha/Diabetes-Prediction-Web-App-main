Here are some problem statements related to diabetes:

Lack of knowledge and skills: There are still patients who don't have the knowledge or skills to manage their diabetes. 

Unawareness: More than half of people with diabetes don't know they have it, which can lead to complications if it's not detected and treated early. 

Algorithm accuracy: Which algorithm is more accurate at predicting diabetes? 
Early prediction: How can diabetes be predicted early? 
Diabetes can lead to many serious health complications, including: Heart attacks and strokes, Kidney failure, Blindness, Lower-limb amputation, and Foot ulcers and infection. 
To prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes, you can: Maintain a normal body weight, Avoid tobacco use, Eat a healthy diet, and Get regular physical activity.

Project overview:


Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose. Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.

In 2014, 8.5% of adults aged 18 years and older had diabetes. In 2019, diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million deaths and 48% of all deaths due to diabetes occurred before the age of 70 years. Another 460 000 kidney disease deaths were caused by diabetes, and raised blood glucose causes around 20% of cardiovascular deaths (1).

Between 2000 and 2019, there was a 3% increase in age-standardized mortality rates from diabetes. In lower-middle-income countries, the mortality rate due to diabetes increased 13%.

By contrast, the probability of dying from any one of the four main noncommunicable diseases (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases or diabetes) between the ages of 30 and 70 decreased by 22% globally between 2000 and 2019. 




 Project introduction:
 
 
 Diabetes mellitus is characterized by abnormally high levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood.

 When the amount of glucose in the blood increases, e.g., after a meal, it triggers the release 
 of the hormone insulin from the pancreas. Insulin stimulates muscle and fat cells to remove 
 glucose from the blood and stimulates the liver to metabolize glucose, causing the blood sugar 
 level to decrease to normal levels.

 In people with diabetes, blood sugar levels remain high. This may be because insulin is not 
 being produced at all, is not made at sufficient levels, or is not as effective as it should 
 be. The most common forms of diabetes are type 1 diabetes (5%), which is an autoimmune 
 disorder, and type 2 diabetes (95%), which is associated with obesity. Gestational diabetes is 
 a form of diabetes that occurs in pregnancy, and other forms of diabetes are very rare and are 
 caused by a single gene mutation.
